ASCII art of anime characters

## tool for creating

I made a tool at https://tkoz0.github.io/ascii-outline-editor/ that can be used
for editing ASCII art. The repo is https://github.com/tkoz0/ascii-outline-editor

## contributing guidelines

These definitely will not cover all cases. If something is unclear, feel free to
suggest edits to this section.

1. ASCII art should be of an anime character. For now, I will define an anime as
anything you can find on MyAnimeList, Anilist, VNDB, or similar sites.
2. Place files into a directory named in the format `Anime_Name`. If a character
is in multiple series or multiple names could work, pick the one that makes most
sense.
3. Name ASCII art files with the character name(s), or possibly something a bit
more descriptive. The file extensions should be `.txt`
4. Provide a source image. If it's a screenshot from an anime, please include it
directly in the repository as an image with the same file name, but appropriate
extension. If it's a fan art, include a link in the `.txt` file. Links should be
to the artist page (Pixiv/Twitter/etc), not a site like Gelbooru or Danbooru.
5. SFW art only please.
